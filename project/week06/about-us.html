            <h2>Our Story and Mission</h2>
            <p>
                The idea of CareerBridge was born from the observation that many young professionals in Kinshasa and across the DRC lack the resources to effectively navigate their careers. The job market is constantly evolving, and traditional job search methods are no longer enough. Our founder, who personally experienced the challenges of starting a career, created CareerBridge to fill this gap.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our mission is to democratize access to quality career coaching by offering personalized services tailored to local realities. We are committed to helping each individual discover their unique potential, develop cutting-edge skills, and connect with the opportunities that suit them best. We believe the success of the DRC lies in the success of its talents, and we are proud to play a role in their professional growth.
            </p>
            <h2>Our Vision for the DRC</h2>
            <p>
                We dream of a DRC where every talent is valued and where young professionals are fully equipped to face the challenges of the job market. We work to build a bridge between emerging talents and opportunities by creating a community of mentorship and mutual support. Our goal is to make CareerBridge the leading reference in career development in the DRC, actively contributing to a stronger and more dynamic economy.
